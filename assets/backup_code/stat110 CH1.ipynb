    "## Ch1: Counting and Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanna take some notes on this course although I have learned most of this. Some of it is very simple and other concepts not so much. For the first chapter or two I may not take a lot of notes since it's second nature. We'll see what I end up doing\n",
    "for the problems, perhaps just the ones with solutions or the interesting ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions:\n",
    "* **Sample space**: The *sample space* $S$ of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes  \n",
    "* **Event**: An event $A$ is a subset of $S$. When we say that $A$ *ocurred* we mean that the outcome of the experiment was in $A$.  \n",
    "* **Naive probability**: The probability of an event $A$ is the number of elements in $A$ divided by the number of elements in $S$.\n",
    "* **Symmetry**: Naive probability depends on the idea that all outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "* **Simple random sample**: A subset of the sample space with symmetric probability. This is often desired but rarely achieved. Sometimes this is assumed as a *null model* in order to test the idea that all the outcomes are equally likely.\n",
    "* **Binomial coefficients**: For positive integers $n$ and $k$, the number of subsets of a set with $n$ elements of size $k$ is $n\\choose k$, else 0.\n",
    "* **Probability space**: A probability space must have these elements:\n",
    "    - A set called the sample space $S$\n",
    "    - A probability function $P$ that has these properties:\n",
    "        - The domain is all subsets of $S$\n",
    "        - The codomain is real numbers in [0,1]\n",
    "        - $P(\\emptyset) = 0$ and $P(S) = 1$\n",
    "        - Given any set (infinite or finite) of disjoint subsets of $S$, $A_{1},A_{2}...$ we have $P(\\bigcup\\limits_{j=1}^{\\infty} A_{i}) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty$$P(A_{j})$\n",
    "* **Frequentist perspective**: When we say that an event $A$ has a probability of 0.5, that means that over a very large number of repititions of the experiment, the proportion of experiments resullting in $A$ will result approach 50%\n",
    "* **Bayesian perspective**: Probabilities represent beliefs about the likelihood of an event happening. Under this perspective, probabilities can be assigned to experiments that only happen once or a few times as well as experiments that have already been run but the outcome is unknown."

    "### Theorems:\n",
    "* **Multiplication rule** If an experiment is composed of two subexperiments, $A$ & $B$, where $A$ has $a$ possibilities and $B$ has $b$ possiblities, then the total number of posibilities is $ab$. This generalizes to outcomes within an experiment and any number of subexperiments.\n",
    "* **Sampling with replacement**: When sampling $k$ outcomes from $n$ distinct outcomes and replacing after the selection, the total number of possibilties is $n^k$\n",
    "* **Sampling without replacement**: When sampling $k$ outcomes from $n$ distinct outcomes and not replacing after the selection, the total number of possibilties is $n(n-1)(n-2)...(n-k+1)$\n",
    "* **Permutation**: A sample without replacement of the size of the sample space is called a permutation.\n",
    "* **Binomial coefficients formula**: For natural numbers $n \\geq k$, $n\\choose k$ $= \\frac{n(n-1)...(n-k+1)}{k!} = \\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$  \n",
    "* **Bose-Einstein**: The number of ways to select $k$ *indistinguishabl* objects from a set of size $n$ is $n+k-1 \\choose k$. This is demonstrated with the 'stars and bars' argument of filling k containers with n objects.\n",
    "* **Binomial compliment**: Assuming $k \\leq n$, $n \\choose k$$=$$n \\choose n-k$. This is like saying that there are as many ways to choose the $k$ elements selected as there are the $n-k$ elements *not* selected.\n",
    "* **Team and captain**: If $k \\leq n$ then $n$$n-1 \\choose k-1$ $=$$k$$n \\choose k$. This is selecting a team of size $k$ from $n$ prospects and then choosing a captain. You can choose the captain then the rest of the team or choose the team and then choose the captain from that team.\n",
    "* **Vandermonde's Identity**: For non-negative $m, n, k$, $m+n\\choose k$$=\\sum_{j=0}^k$$n\\choose j$$m \\choose k-j$. To me this is saying that if we pool two disjoint groups $(m$ and $n)$ and then select $k$ members from that pool, we also could have selected them from each of the groups independently so that the sum stays at $k$.\n",
    "* **Partnerships**: Given $n\\geq 0$, $\\frac{(2n)!}{2^{n}n!} = (2n-1)(2n-3)...3\\cdot1$. This describes the number of ways to partner up the members of a set of size $2n$. On the LHS we can order them in whatever pairing up 1&2, 3&4... This over counts in two ways. First off, each pairing could be internally reversed. Secondly, the order of the pairs themseleves could be reordered in $n!$ ways. The RHS says we have $2n-1$ potential partners for the first member, then once selected the next member has $2n-3$ potential partners and so fourth.\n",
    "* **Basic properties of probability**\n",
    "    * $P(A^{c}) = 1-P(A)$\n",
    "    * If $A\\subseteq B$ then $P(A)\\leq P(B)$\n",
    "* **Inclusion-Exclusion property**: The latex will be too annoying for this one. It basically says that if we have any number of subsets of $S$, we can compute the probability of their union as the sum of their individual probabilities, minus their pairwise intersections, plus their three way intersections, minus their four way intersections... \n",
    "\n",
    "### Other Notes:\n",
    "* I find it very comforting that Leibniz believed that a roll of 11 and 12 were equally likely with two dice. I was caught by one of the examples in this and it's good to remember that humans are not so great with probability."
