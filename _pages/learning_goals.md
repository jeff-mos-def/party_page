I have a lot of goals and not a lot of extra time. Here's a list of things that I want to learn/review in the next year or so.

* Stats (mostly review)  
  - Probability
  - GLM
  - Survival analysis
  - Mixed effects models
  - Non-inferiority testing
  - Different measures of difference (ASD, SMD, ect.)
* Machine learning
  - Random forests
  - [~~K-means~~](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/k_means)
  - Neural networks (maybe not)
* Programming
  - Get better at python: numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit
  - More SQL improvement
  - Latex
  - Shiny?
