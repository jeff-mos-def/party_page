My path to being interested in data, statistics, and programming was pretty haphazard. I majored in math mostly because I couldn't get an A in any other subject. I studied statistics because I thought there was a vague chance I'd rather do something with data than be a teacher. Now I get paid to write ugly R programs full time.

I'm most interested in using my skill set for: 
+ Non-profit work
+ Creating educational materials
+ Social sciences
+ Creative expression

I'm also interested in becoming skilled in Mexican cooking. Hit me up with your recipies.
