My path to being interested in data, statistics, and programming was pretty haphazard. I studied math because I couldn't get an A in any other subject, dropped the only programming class I signed up for in college, and didn't like statistics until after completing my MS. Now I get paid to write R programs full time. My favorite aspects are data visualization and making the computer do my bidding.

I'm most interested in using my skill set for: 
+ Non-profit work
+ Creating educational materials
+ Social sciences
+ Creative expression

My near term goals are to become a proficient python programmer and expand my SQL skills.

I'm also interested in becoming skilled in Mexican cooking. Hit me up with your recipes.
