title: "Topics to learn"
---

So I have a lot of goals and not a lot of time. Here's a list of things that I want to learn in the next year or so.

* Stats (mostly review)  
  - Probability
 - GLM
 - Survival analysis
 - Mixed effects models
 - Non-inferiority testing
 - Different measures of difference (ASD, SMD, ect.)
* Machine learning
 - Random forests
 - [~~K-means~~](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/k_means)
 - Neural networks (maybe not)
